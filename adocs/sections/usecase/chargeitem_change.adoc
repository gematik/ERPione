== Change charge items
Charge items that have been set initially can be changed later at the request of the insured person.
To change an existing charge item, use the following command:

[source,shell,subs="attributes"]
----
{app-name-cli} chargeitem change --taskid [TID] --accesscode [AC] [path/to/payload.json]

{app-name-cli} chargeitem change -t 200.000.002.175.581.70 \
      -a 9ea09db15e04fe9b1613cd0a338b812c728b355d672d9af8e54b7596e9098fa8 \
      ./resources/my_examples/chargeitem_payload.json
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
In this use case, the AccessCode has the same structure and the same name as the AccessCode of a prescription. However, the two values are different and should not be confused.

The AccessCode for the ChargeItem is regenerated by the FD when `create` and `change` and must be called up again by the FdV after each change.
