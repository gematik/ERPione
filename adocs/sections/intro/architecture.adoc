== Architecture
The architecture of {app-name} follows a modular client-server approach, separating responsibilities between backend, frontend, and proxy components to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clear abstraction of technical details.

=== Backend
The backend handles all tasks such as communicating with the TI, processing link:https://www.hl7.org/fhir/[FHIR] or creating cryptographic signatures.

=== Frontend
The frontend itself is relatively lean (link:https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_Client[Thin Client]). It therefore contains little to no domain knowledge, e.g. about FHIR or the e-prescription itself, but merely serves as an intermediary between the user and the backend service.

=== Proxy
The proxy is almost transparent to the user, but performs two essential tasks: routing to the appropriate environments and access control to the actual service via link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_key[API keys].
